# Redis API Endpoints Update - Build Notes

**Date**: May 31, 2025  
**Task**: Update API endpoints to use Redis via hybridDataService  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Developer**: Claude 3.7 Sonnet

## Summary

Successfully updated all API endpoints to use the hybridDataService instead of direct JSON file operations. This change resolves the EROFS (read-only file system) error in production environments by using Redis as the data storage backend, with fallback to JSON files when needed.

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made

1. Updated the following API endpoints:

   - `app/api/projects/route.ts` - List all projects
   - `app/api/projects/[slug]/route.ts` - Get project by slug
   - `app/api/resources/route.ts` - List all resources
   - `app/api/resources/[slug]/route.ts` - Get resource by slug

2. Implementation pattern:

   - Replaced direct imports of ProjectService/ResourceService with hybridDataService
   - Updated service method calls to use the hybrid service equivalents
   - Added null metadata checks to prevent runtime errors
   - Enhanced error handling with proper status codes and messages

3. Bug fixes:
   - Fixed potential errors when metadata is undefined
   - Improved handling of "not found" cases
   - Added proper null checks before accessing object properties

### Code Snippets

From `app/api/projects/route.ts`:

```typescript
// Before
const projects = await ProjectService.listProjects();

// After
const projects = await hybridDataService.getProjects();
```

From `app/api/projects/[slug]/route.ts`:

```typescript
// Before
const project = await ProjectService.getProject(slug);

// After
const project = await hybridDataService.getProject(slug);

if (!project) {
  // Handle not found case
}
```

### Error Handling Improvements

Added robust null checks for metadata:

```typescript
// Before
if (project.metadata.status !== "published") { ... }

// After
if (!project.metadata || project.metadata.status !== "published") { ... }
```

### Testing Results

Tested all endpoints with Redis feature flags enabled:

- GET `/api/projects` - ✅ Success (200)
- GET `/api/projects/rdv-artisan` - ✅ Success (200)
- GET `/api/resources` - ✅ Success (200)
- GET `/api/resources/templates` - ✅ Success (200)

All endpoints now successfully retrieve data from Redis and properly handle error cases.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Null Checks are Critical**: Always add proper null/undefined checks before accessing nested properties, especially when data might come from different sources.

2. **Hybrid Data Access**: The hybridDataService pattern works well for gradual migration, providing both Redis and JSON access with feature flag control.

3. **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling with proper status codes improves API reliability.

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to production
2. Monitor performance and logs
3. Complete full migration to Redis-only mode when stable
