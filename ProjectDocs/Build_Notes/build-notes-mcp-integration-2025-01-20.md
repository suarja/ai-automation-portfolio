# Build Notes: MCP Integration & API Refactoring

**Date**: 2025-01-20  
**Task Group**: Level 3 MCP Integration Project  
**Phase**: PLAN Mode (Detailed Planning) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

## Session Overview

**Previous Phase**: VAN Mode (Analysis & Setup) ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Current Phase**: PLAN Mode - Comprehensive Planning ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Next Phase**: CREATIVE Mode - Architecture & Algorithm Design  
**Focus**: Design data schemas, API architecture, and MCP server implementation strategy

## Progress Summary

### VAN Phase Achievements (Completed)

- ‚úÖ Memory Bank structure established with 6 core documentation files
- ‚úÖ Project complexity assessed as Level 3 (Intermediate Feature)
- ‚úÖ Current architecture analyzed (Next.js 15 with hardcoded data)
- ‚úÖ Technical requirements clarified (MCP + API refactoring goals)
- ‚úÖ Git commit completed with comprehensive documentation

### PLAN Phase Achievements (Completed)

- ‚úÖ Data schema design for projects and resources (TypeScript interfaces)
- ‚úÖ API architecture specification (RESTful endpoints structure)
- ‚úÖ MCP server architecture design (WebSocket + HTTP handlers)
- ‚úÖ Technology stack validation plan (new dependencies identified)
- ‚úÖ Implementation roadmap with 3-phase strategy
- ‚úÖ Creative phase identification (Architecture + Algorithm design)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive risk mitigation strategies
- ‚úÖ Testing strategy (unit, integration, load testing)
- ‚úÖ Documentation plan defined

## Key Decisions Made

### Architecture Approach

- **Data Storage**: JSON files in `/public/data/` (no database complexity)
- **API Layer**: Next.js API routes with RESTful design
- **MCP Integration**: Dedicated MCP server process (port 3001)
- **Authentication**: Token-based security for write operations

### Data Schema Specifications

- **Project Schema**: 15 fields including client info, solution details, testimonials
- **Resource Schema**: 10 fields including pricing, gallery, metadata
- **Audit Log Schema**: Comprehensive change tracking with source identification
- **API Response Format**: Consistent response structure with success/error handling

### Technology Stack Validation

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (current) + Express.js (MCP server)
- **New Dependencies**: 8 packages identified (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk, ws, express, etc.)
- **Type Safety**: Maintained end-to-end TypeScript consistency
- **File Operations**: Atomic writes with file locking for concurrency

## Implementation Strategy Defined

### Phase 1: Data Migration & API Foundation

1. Extract hardcoded data to JSON files (4 data files)
2. Build API endpoints (projects/resources CRUD)
3. Refactor components to use API with loading states

### Phase 2: MCP Server Implementation

1. Setup MCP server infrastructure (Express.js + WebSocket)
2. MCP protocol integration with real-time synchronization
3. Add audit logging and authentication

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation

1. Comprehensive API testing (unit + integration)
2. MCP integration testing with real clients
3. Performance and security validation

## Creative Phases Identified

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Design REQUIRED

- MCP server architecture design decisions
- File system concurrency management approach
- Error handling and fallback strategies
- Real-time synchronization design patterns

### ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Design REQUIRED

- Atomic file operations algorithm
- Conflict resolution for concurrent writes
- Caching invalidation strategy
- Real-time update propagation logic

### üé® UI/UX Design NOT REQUIRED

- Current UI preserved completely - no design decisions needed

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Priority Risks

1. **File Concurrency**: Multiple simultaneous writes to JSON files

   - **Mitigation**: File locking + atomic writes + backup strategy

2. **Data Migration**: Data loss during hardcoded extraction

   - **Mitigation**: Backup original files + schema validation + gradual migration

3. **MCP Protocol**: Learning curve for new technology integration
   - **Mitigation**: Early proof of concept + comprehensive testing + fallback mechanisms

### Medium Priority Risks

4. **Performance**: API calls slower than hardcoded access
   - **Mitigation**: Aggressive caching + static generation + lazy loading

## Technology Validation Required

### Validation Checklist (Pending)

- [ ] Install MCP SDK and verify API compatibility
- [ ] Create hello world MCP server
- [ ] Test WebSocket connection with MCP client
- [ ] Verify Express.js integration with Next.js
- [ ] Test file locking mechanism for concurrent writes
- [ ] Validate JSON schema with Zod

## Next Actions

### Immediate (CREATIVE Phase)

1. Architecture design decisions for MCP server components
2. Algorithm design for atomic file operations
3. Real-time synchronization strategy design
4. Error handling and fallback mechanism design

### Following (Implementation)

1. Technology validation and proof of concept
2. Data extraction and JSON file creation
3. API endpoint implementation
4. MCP server development

## Notes & Insights
