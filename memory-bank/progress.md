   - ✅ Feature requirements clarified (MCP integration + API refactoring)
   - ✅ Technical constraints identified (no database, JSON files)
   - ✅ Success criteria defined

3. **Documentation Foundation**
   - ✅ Project brief established (`projectbrief.md`)
   - ✅ Product context defined (`productContext.md`)
   - ✅ System patterns documented (`systemPatterns.md`)
   - ✅ Technical context captured (`techContext.md`)
   - ✅ Active context maintained (`activeContext.md`)
   - ✅ Task tracking initiated (`tasks.md`)

## RISK REGISTER

### Technical Risks (Identified in VAN)

- **File Concurrency**: Multiple writes to JSON files
  - **Impact**: Medium | **Probability**: Low
  - **Mitigation**: File locking, atomic writes
- **MCP Protocol Learning Curve**: New technology integration

  - **Impact**: Medium | **Probability**: Medium
  - **Mitigation**: Prototype first, comprehensive testing

- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring no data loss during migration
  - **Impact**: High | **Probability**: Low
  - **Mitigation**: Backup strategy, validation checks

### Business Risks (Identified in VAN)

- **User Experience Disruption**: API calls replacing direct data access

  - **Impact**: Medium | **Probability**: Low
  - **Mitigation**: Performance optimization, caching strategy

- **Demo Reliability**: Need consistent demonstration scenarios
  - **Impact**: Medium | **Probability**: Medium
  - **Mitigation**: Fallback scenarios, thorough testing
