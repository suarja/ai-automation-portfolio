## CORRECTED IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Original PLAN vs CREATIVE Corrections

**Original PLAN (Too Complex)**:

- Separate Express.js server on port 3001
- Manual WebSocket/HTTP handler setup
- 8 new dependencies (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk, ws, express, cors, etc.)
- Complex MCP protocol implementation

**CREATIVE Correction (Right-Sized)**:

- Single Next.js API route using Vercel adapter
- Automatic transport handling via adapter
- Only 1 new dependency (@vercel/mcp-adapter)
- Simplified integration with full MCP capabilities

### Corrected Phase Breakdown

#### Phase 1: Data Layer Foundation (Immediate Priority)

- `lib/services/fileOperations.ts` - Atomic file operations with copy-on-write
- `lib/services/projectService.ts` - Project CRUD using FileOperations
- `lib/services/resourceService.ts` - Resource CRUD using FileOperations
- `lib/types/` - TypeScript interfaces (from PLAN phase schemas)
- `lib/utils/validation.ts` - Zod schemas for MCP tool parameters

#### Phase 2: MCP Integration (Core Feature)

- `app/api/mcp/route.ts` - Single MCP endpoint using `createMcpHandler`
- 6 MCP tools: list/get/update for projects and resources
- Integration with service layer for business logic

#### Phase 3: Data Migration (Foundation)

- Extract hardcoded data to `/public/data/projects.json`
- Extract hardcoded data to `/public/data/resources.json`
- Initialize `/public/data/audit.json` for change tracking

#### Phase 4: UI Integration (Minimal Changes)

- Refactor `app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx` to use API data
- Refactor `app/resources/[slug]/page.tsx` to use API data
- Add loading states and error handling
