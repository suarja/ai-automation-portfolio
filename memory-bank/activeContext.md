# ACTIVE CONTEXT

## CURRENT PROJECT STATE

**Date**: Redis Migration Creative Phases Complete  
**Mode**: CREATIVE → IMPLEMENT Transition  
**Status**: Level 3 Architecture & Migration Strategy Complete - Ready for Implementation

## IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES

1. **Architecture Design**: ✅ COMPLETED - @upstash/redis with optimized structure
2. **Migration Strategy**: ✅ COMPLETED - Gradual feature flag-based approach
3. **Current Phase**: Ready for IMPLEMENT mode - Execute Redis migration

## CREATIVE PHASES COMPLETION SUMMARY

### Phase 1: Redis Data Architecture ✅ COMPLETED

**Architecture Decision**: @upstash/redis with Custom Configuration

- **Optimal Key Structure**: Namespaced design for performance (`data:projects:{id}`, `index:published:projects`)
- **Connection Management**: Dual client setup (read/write + read-only)
- **Performance Strategy**: Pipeline operations, Lua scripts, TTL management
- **Error Handling**: Circuit breaker, exponential backoff, graceful degradation

**Technical Validation**:

- Environment variables compatible ✅
- Redis features sufficient ✅
- TypeScript integration maintained ✅
- Vercel serverless optimized ✅

### Phase 2: Migration Strategy ✅ COMPLETED

**Migration Strategy**: Gradual Feature Flag-Based Migration

- **Zero Downtime**: Progressive cutover with immediate rollback capability
- **Timeline**: 7-day rollout (Infrastructure → Background Migration → Gradual Cutover → Cleanup)
- **Validation**: Real-time consistency checking and monitoring
- **Risk Management**: Low risk with granular control at each stage

**Implementation Components Designed**:

- Feature flag system for data source control
- Dual-read/dual-write implementation
- Background batch migrator with retry logic
- Comprehensive validation and monitoring
- Emergency rollback procedures

## REDIS MIGRATION IMPLEMENTATION READINESS

### Architecture Complete ✅

**Target Architecture**:

```
New Redis-Based Data Layer (DESIGNED):
├── Redis Storage: @upstash/redis with Vercel KV ✅ Architecture complete
├── Service Layer: Enhanced Redis services ✅ Implementation plan ready
├── MCP Integration: 8 tools working in production ✅ Update strategy defined
└── Production Ready: Full read/write capabilities ✅ Migration strategy ready
```

**Key Structure Optimized**:

```
Redis Namespace Design (FINALIZED):
├── data:projects:{id} → Project data with metadata
├── data:resources:{id} → Resource data with metadata
├── index:published:projects → Set for published projects
├── index:published:resources → Set for published resources
├── audit:entries → Sorted set (score = timestamp)
├── cache:api:projects → API response cache
└── meta:schema:version → Current schema version
```

### Migration Strategy Complete ✅

**7-Day Implementation Timeline**:

- **Day 1**: Infrastructure deployment (feature flags, dual-read)
- **Day 2-3**: Background data migration in batches
- **Day 4**: Gradual read cutover with monitoring
- **Day 5**: Dual-write mode activation
- **Day 6**: Full Redis cutover
- **Day 7**: Cleanup and optimization

**Risk Mitigation Strategy**:

- Feature flags enable instant rollback at any stage
- Dual-write ensures no data loss during transition
- Continuous validation prevents inconsistencies
- Comprehensive monitoring with automated alerts

## IMPLEMENTATION COMPONENTS READY

### Technical Infrastructure

- **Dependencies**: @upstash/redis installed ✅
- **Environment Variables**: Vercel KV credentials available ✅
- **Connection Strategy**: Dual client configuration designed ✅
- **Key Management**: Optimized namespace structure defined ✅

### Service Layer Migration

- **Redis Services**: Implementation blueprints complete ✅
- **API Compatibility**: Interface preservation strategy defined ✅
- **MCP Integration**: Update plan for all 8 tools ready ✅

- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability designed ✅

## SUCCESS METRICS DEFINED

### Primary Goals (READY FOR VALIDATION)

- **Production MCP Functionality**: All 8 MCP tools working remotely
- **Data Integrity**: 100% data preservation during migration
- **Performance**: ≤100ms read, ≤200ms write operations
- **Zero Downtime**: No service interruption during migration

### Implementation Readiness Checklist

- [✅] Architecture decisions finalized
- [✅] Migration strategy validated
- [✅] Implementation components designed
- [✅] Risk mitigation strategies defined
- [✅] Rollback procedures established
- [✅] Timeline and milestones set

## NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

**Current Mode**: CREATIVE ✅ Complete (Both phases finished)  
**Next Mode**: IMPLEMENT - Execute Redis migration per designed strategy
**Implementation Strategy**: Follow 7-day gradual migration plan

The Creative phases have successfully designed a comprehensive Redis migration solution that will resolve the production MCP issue while maintaining system stability and enabling full remote content management capabilities.

**Status**: Creative design complete, ready for implementation execution.
