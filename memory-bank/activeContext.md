# ACTIVE CONTEXT

## CURRENT PROJECT STATE

**Date**: CREATIVE Phase Completion  
**Mode**: CREATIVE → IMPLEMENT Transition  
**Status**: Level 3 Creative Decisions Complete

## IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES

1. **CREATIVE Phase**: ✅ COMPLETED - Architecture and algorithm design decisions finalized
2. **Next Phase**: IMPLEMENT mode for actual development work
3. **Focus**: Build the corrected architecture using Vercel MCP adapter with atomic file operations

## KEY ACHIEVEMENTS FROM CREATIVE PHASE

### Architecture Decision: Vercel MCP Adapter Integration

**CORRECTED APPROACH**: Original PLAN phase was based on incomplete information. New approach uses:

- **Vercel MCP Adapter**: Direct Next.js integration, no separate Express.js server
- **Single Endpoint**: `app/api/mcp/route.ts` using `createMcpHandler`
- **Simplified Transport**: Adapter handles WebSocket/HTTP automatically
- **Clean Separation**: Modular data services layer

### Algorithm Decision: Copy-on-Write with Checksums

**ATOMIC FILE OPERATIONS**:

- **Copy-on-Write Pattern**: File system rename for atomicity
- **Data Integrity**: SHA256 checksum verification
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic cleanup on failure
- **Audit Trail**: Built-in change tracking

### Technology Correction

**Simplified Dependencies**:

- Only need `@vercel/mcp-adapter` (includes MCP SDK 1.12.0)
- No Express.js, WebSocket libraries, or Redis required
- Direct Next.js API route integration

## CREATIVE DECISIONS FINALIZED

### ✅ Architecture Design COMPLETED

**Decision**: Modular Data Layer with Vercel MCP Adapter

- Single MCP endpoint with clean service separation
- No Redis required for initial implementation
- Direct Next.js integration without separate server
- Service layer: ProjectService, ResourceService, FileOperations

### ✅ Algorithm Design COMPLETED

**Decision**: Copy-on-Write with Checksums

- Atomic file operations using file system guarantees
- Data integrity verification with SHA256
- Built-in error recovery and audit logging
- Right complexity for Level 3 project

### ❌ UI/UX Design NOT REQUIRED

**Decision**: Preserve current UI completely

- Zero UI changes needed
- Focus on backend integration only

## IMPLEMENTATION READINESS ASSESSMENT

### Phase 1: Data Layer Foundation ✅ READY

- Service architecture designed (ProjectService, ResourceService, FileOperations)
- Algorithm chosen (copy-on-write with checksums)
- File structure planned (/lib/services/, /lib/types/, /lib/utils/)
- Atomic operations algorithm detailed

### Phase 2: MCP Integration ✅ READY

- Vercel MCP adapter approach designed
- Tool definitions planned (6 main tools: list/get/update for projects/resources)
- Integration pattern established (createMcpHandler in app/api/mcp/route.ts)
- Correct dependency identified: @vercel/mcp-adapter

### Phase 3: Data Migration ✅ READY

- JSON file structure planned (/public/data/\*.json)
- Data extraction strategy defined (hardcoded → JSON files)
- Schema validation approach planned (existing Zod schemas)

### Phase 4: UI Integration ✅ READY

- Component refactoring strategy defined
- API integration approach planned
- Loading states and error handling planned

## CORRECTED IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Data Layer Foundation

```
lib/
├── services/
│   ├── projectService.ts      # Project CRUD with FileOperations
│   ├── resourceService.ts     # Resource CRUD with FileOperations
│   ├── auditService.ts        # Audit log operations
│   └── fileOperations.ts      # Atomic file I/O with checksums

└── utils/
    ├── validation.ts          # Zod schemas for MCP tools
    └── constants.ts           # File paths (/public/data/*.json)
```

### Phase 2: MCP Integration

```
Dependencies: @vercel/mcp-adapter
File: app/api/mcp/route.ts (Single MCP endpoint using createMcpHandler)
```

### Phase 3: Data Migration

```
Data files:
- public/data/projects.json    # Extracted from hardcoded data
- public/data/resources.json   # Extracted from hardcoded data
- public/data/audit.json       # Initialize empty audit log
```

### Phase 4: UI Integration

```
Components to refactor:
- app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx # Use API instead of hardcoded data
- app/resources/[slug]/page.tsx # Use API instead of hardcoded data
```

## SUCCESS CRITERIA STATUS

- [x] Architecture design decisions finalized (Vercel MCP adapter approach)
- [x] Algorithm design patterns established (copy-on-write with checksums)
- [x] Error handling and fallback strategies designed (automatic cleanup)
- [x] Real-time synchronization patterns defined (via MCP adapter)
- [x] Implementation strategy corrected and simplified
- [x] Technology stack validated (single dependency)

## NEXT ACTIONS

### IMPLEMENT Phase (Immediate)

1. **Install Dependencies**: Add @vercel/mcp-adapter
2. **Create Data Layer**: Implement FileOperations with copy-on-write algorithm
3. **Build Services**: Implement ProjectService and ResourceService
4. **Create MCP Endpoint**: Implement app/api/mcp/route.ts with Vercel adapter
5. **Extract Data**: Move hardcoded data to JSON files
6. **Test Integration**: Verify MCP tools work with Claude

### Post-Implementation Actions

1. Comprehensive testing with MCP clients
2. Performance validation
3. Error scenario testing
4. Documentation and demo preparation

## CONTEXT FOR IMPLEMENT PHASE

**Architecture Corrected**: Simplified approach using Vercel MCP adapter eliminates complex server setup planned in original PLAN phase

**Algorithms Chosen**: Copy-on-write provides atomic operations with data integrity - perfect balance for Level 3 complexity

**Implementation Ready**: All design decisions made, technology validated, clear development path established

**Critical Insight**: Original planning went off track due to missing Vercel MCP adapter context. Creative phase successfully corrected the approach to use much simpler and more appropriate architecture.

**READY FOR IMPLEMENT MODE** - All creative decisions complete, simplified implementation strategy clear

**User Action**: Type `IMPLEMENT` to begin development phase
