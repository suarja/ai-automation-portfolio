# ACTIVE CONTEXT

## CURRENT PROJECT STATE

**Date**: PLAN Phase Completion  
**Mode**: PLAN → CREATIVE Transition  
**Status**: Level 3 Comprehensive Planning Complete

## IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES

1. **PLAN Phase**: ✅ COMPLETED - Comprehensive planning with data schemas, API architecture, MCP server design
2. **Next Phase**: CREATIVE mode for architecture and algorithm design decisions
3. **Focus**: Design critical architectural patterns and algorithms for MCP integration

## KEY ACHIEVEMENTS FROM PLAN PHASE

### Comprehensive Planning Completed

- **Data Schemas**: TypeScript interfaces for Projects, Resources, and Audit logs
- **API Architecture**: RESTful endpoint structure with 7 main routes
- **MCP Server Design**: Component architecture with WebSocket/HTTP handlers
- **Implementation Strategy**: 3-phase approach with clear deliverables
- **Risk Mitigation**: Strategies for file concurrency, data migration, and performance

### Technical Specifications Defined

- **Project Schema**: 15 fields covering client info, solutions, testimonials, results
- **Resource Schema**: 10 fields including pricing, gallery, metadata tracking
- **API Response Format**: Consistent structure with success/error handling
- **MCP Handler Interface**: Core operations for projects/resources management

### Technology Stack Validated

- **Current Stack**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript 5, Tailwind CSS - all verified
- **New Dependencies**: 8 packages identified for MCP integration (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk, ws, express, cors, etc.)
- **Integration Plan**: Express.js MCP server on port 3001 with WebSocket support

## CREATIVE PHASES IDENTIFIED

### 🏗️ Architecture Design REQUIRED

**Status**: Ready for CREATIVE phase  
**Focus Areas**:

- MCP server component architecture and service separation
- File system concurrency management (atomic operations, locking)
- Error handling hierarchy and fallback strategies
- Real-time synchronization patterns between MCP clients and data layer

### ⚙️ Algorithm Design REQUIRED

**Status**: Ready for CREATIVE phase  
**Focus Areas**:

- Atomic file operations algorithm (read-modify-write with rollback)
- Conflict resolution for concurrent write scenarios
- Caching invalidation strategy for API responses
- Real-time update propagation logic (WebSocket event handling)

### 🎨 UI/UX Design NOT REQUIRED

**Status**: Skipped  
**Reason**: Current UI preserved completely - zero design decisions needed

## IMPLEMENTATION READINESS ASSESSMENT

### Phase 1 Ready: Data Migration & API Foundation

- [x] JSON file structure designed (`/public/data/*.json`)
- [x] API endpoint architecture planned (7 main routes)
- [x] Component refactoring strategy defined
- [x] Migration safety measures planned

### Phase 2 Ready: MCP Server Implementation

- [x] MCP server architecture designed
- [x] Protocol integration approach planned
- [x] Authentication and audit logging strategy defined
- [ ] **Creative decisions needed** for architectural patterns

### Phase 3 Ready: Testing & Validation

- [x] Testing strategy comprehensive (unit, integration, load)
- [x] MCP client integration scenarios planned
- [x] Performance validation approach defined

## IDENTIFIED RISKS & MITIGATION STATUS

### Critical Path Risks (Addressed)

- **File Concurrency**: File locking + atomic writes + backup strategy planned ✅
- **Data Migration**: Backup + validation + gradual migration strategy planned ✅
- **MCP Protocol**: Early proof of concept + testing + fallback mechanisms planned ✅
- **Performance**: Caching + static generation + lazy loading strategy planned ✅

### Creative Decision Dependencies

- **Atomic Operations**: Algorithm design needed for safe concurrent file operations
- **Error Handling**: Architecture design needed for comprehensive fallback strategies
- **Real-time Sync**: Algorithm design needed for WebSocket event propagation
- **Service Architecture**: Architecture design needed for MCP server component separation

## SUCCESS CRITERIA STATUS

- [x] Comprehensive requirements analysis completed
- [x] Detailed component identification completed (API, MCP server, data layer)
- [x] Implementation strategy with phased approach completed
- [x] Risk mitigation strategies completed
- [x] Creative phases identified and prioritized
- [x] Testing strategy defined
- [x] Documentation plan created

## NEXT ACTIONS

### CREATIVE Phase (Immediate)

1. **Architecture Design Session**: MCP server component architecture
2. **Algorithm Design Session**: Atomic file operations and conflict resolution
3. **Synchronization Design**: Real-time update propagation patterns
4. **Error Handling Design**: Comprehensive fallback and recovery strategies

### Post-CREATIVE Actions

1. Technology validation with proof of concept
2. Begin Phase 1 implementation (data migration)
3. API endpoint development
4. MCP server implementation

## CONTEXT FOR CREATIVE PHASE

**Transition Ready**: All Level 3 planning requirements satisfied  
**Creative Focus**: Critical architectural and algorithmic decisions that will determine implementation success  
**Design Priority**: Architecture > Algorithm (server structure enables algorithm execution)

**READY FOR CREATIVE MODE** - All planning complete, creative decisions clearly identified

**User Action**: Type `CREATIVE` to begin architecture and algorithm design phase
