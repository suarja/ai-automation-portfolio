# ACTIVE CONTEXT

## CURRENT PROJECT STATE

**Date**: Redis Migration Implementation Started  
**Mode**: IMPLEMENT - Executing Redis Data Layer Migration  
**Status**: Level 3 Implementation Phase 1 - Infrastructure Setup IN PROGRESS

## IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES

1. **Creative Phases**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Architecture & migration strategy designed
2. **Current Phase**: üèóÔ∏è IMPLEMENT Mode - Day 1 Infrastructure Setup
3. **Active Task**: Building Redis client and feature flag infrastructure

## IMPLEMENTATION EXECUTION

### Current Implementation Phase: Infrastructure Setup üèóÔ∏è IN PROGRESS

**Day 1 Tasks**:

- **Redis Client Setup**: ‚è≥ STARTING - Create `lib/redis/client.ts` with dual client configuration
- **Feature Flag System**: ‚è≥ PLANNED - Build migration control system
- **Base Redis Services**: ‚è≥ PLANNED - Common operations and utilities

**Implementation Strategy**: Following gradual feature flag-based migration from creative design
**Timeline**: 7-day progressive implementation as designed

## REDIS MIGRATION CONTEXT

### Problem Being Solved

**Production MCP Issue**: ‚ùå EROFS read-only file system blocking resource updates

- **Local**: MCP backend fully functional ‚úÖ
- **Production**: Cannot write to JSON files ‚ùå
- **Solution**: Migrate to Redis using @upstash/redis with Vercel KV

### Architecture Implemented

**Redis Configuration**: @upstash/redis with optimized structure

- **Dual Clients**: Read/write + read-only client setup
- **Key Structure**: Namespaced design (`data:projects:{id}`, `index:published:projects`)
- **Performance**: Pipeline operations, TTL management, circuit breaker patterns

### Migration Strategy

**Gradual Cutover**: Feature flag controlled progressive migration

- **Zero Downtime**: Dual-read then dual-write approach
- **Validation**: Real-time consistency checking
- **Rollback**: Immediate fallback capability at any stage

---

## IMPLEMENTATION READINESS CONFIRMED

### Environment Setup ‚úÖ

- **Dependencies**: @upstash/redis installed and ready
- **Credentials**: Vercel KV environment variables confirmed available
  - `REDIS_KV_REST_API_URL` ‚úÖ
  - `REDIS_KV_REST_API_TOKEN` ‚úÖ
  - `REDIS_KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN` ‚úÖ

### Creative Design Complete ‚úÖ

- **Architecture**: Redis client & key structure designed
- **Migration Strategy**: 7-day gradual implementation plan
- **Implementation Guidelines**: Detailed component specifications
- **Risk Mitigation**: Comprehensive rollback and monitoring strategy

### Current Build Status ‚úÖ

- **Frontend**: Fully functional with API integration
- **MCP Backend**: Working locally, failing in production
- **API Routes**: All endpoints operational
- **Data**: JSON files ready for migration

## NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

**Current Task**: Phase 1.1 - Redis Client Setup ‚è≥ STARTING
**Implementation Steps**:

1. Create `lib/redis/client.ts` with dual client configuration
2. Add connection validation and error handling
3. Implement type definitions for Redis operations
4. Test Redis connectivity with Vercel KV credentials

**Success Criteria**: Redis client connects successfully and can perform basic read/write operations

**Following Tasks**: Feature flag system ‚Üí Base Redis services ‚Üí Service layer migration
