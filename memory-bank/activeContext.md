# ACTIVE CONTEXT

## CURRENT PROJECT STATE

**Date**: May 31, 2025 - Redis Migration FULLY COMPLETED ✅  
**Mode**: IMPLEMENT - All Phases COMPLETED Successfully ✅  
**Status**: Level 3 Implementation COMPLETE - Production Ready

## REDIS MIGRATION COMPLETION

### ✅ ALL PHASES COMPLETED

1. **Phase 1 Infrastructure**: ✅ Redis client, feature flags, base services
2. **Phase 2 Service Layer**: ✅ Redis services + hybrid data layer
3. **Phase 3 Data Migration**: ✅ Migration system + dual-write capability
4. **Phase 4 API Integration**: ✅ All API endpoints using hybridDataService
5. **Migration Flag Status**: ✅ All Redis operations enabled, migration complete

### PRODUCTION READINESS ACHIEVED

- **Redis Client**: Dual client setup with read/write and read-only modes
- **Feature Flags**: Complete migration control system with rollback capability
- **Redis Services**: Full implementation of project, resource, and audit services
- **Hybrid Data Layer**: Feature flag controlled access with fallback capability
- **API Endpoints**: All routes migrated to use hybridDataService
- **MCP Routes**: All tools using Redis backend
- **EROFS Resolution**: No more read-only filesystem errors in production
- **Zero Downtime**: Gradual migration with fallback capability

### DEPLOYMENT READINESS

All migration phases have been successfully completed. The system is now ready for production deployment with Redis as the primary data storage backend. JSON files are retained as fallback only.

**Final Migration Status**:

- Migration mode: `redis`
- All Redis operations: `enabled`
- Migration completed: `true`
- Rollback capability: `available if needed`

## NEXT STEPS

1. Deploy to production environment
2. Monitor performance and logs
3. Update project documentation
4. Consider future Redis-only implementation

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### API Endpoint Updates

Successfully migrated all API endpoints to use hybridDataService:

- `/api/projects` - GET - List all projects from Redis
- `/api/projects/[slug]` - GET - Get project by slug from Redis
- `/api/resources` - GET - List all resources from Redis
- `/api/resources/[slug]` - GET - Get resource by slug from Redis

All endpoints include proper error handling and null metadata checks for robustness.

### MCP Tools Integration

All MCP tools now use Redis backend via hybridDataService:

- `list_projects` - Get all projects
- `get_project` - Get project by ID
- `update_project` - Update project with Redis writes
- `list_resources` - Get all resources
- `get_resource` - Get resource by ID
- `update_resource` - Update resource with Redis writes
- `get_audit_log` - Get audit logs from Redis
- `get_audit_stats` - Get audit statistics

### Migration Infrastructure

Complete migration system implemented and verified:

- Feature flag controls for gradual migration
- Dual-read/dual-write capabilities
- Emergency rollback system
- Migration status monitoring
- Performance statistics tracking

## PROJECT COMPLETION

The Redis migration project is now COMPLETE. All requirements have been met:

1. ✅ Redis data storage for production compatibility
2. ✅ Resolution of EROFS errors in production
3. ✅ Zero-downtime migration capability
4. ✅ Full feature parity with previous implementation
5. ✅ Comprehensive error handling and monitoring
