### VAN ANALYSIS FINDINGS

#### Current Codebase Analysis

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router ✅
- **Data Storage**: Hardcoded objects in React components ⚠️
- **Routes**: Dynamic routes `/projects/[slug]` and `/resources/[slug]` ✅
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Radix UI ✅
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript throughout ✅

#### Data Extraction Requirements

- **Projects Data**: Located in `/app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx` (lines ~15-100)
- **Resources Data**: Located in `/app/resources/[slug]/page.tsx` (lines ~15-50)
- **Target Location**: `/public/data/*.json` files
- **Estimated Records**: ~4-6 projects, ~6-8 resources

#### MCP Integration Requirements

- **New Dependencies**: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `ws`, `express`, `cors`
- **New Server**: MCP server process (port 3001)
- **API Layer**: Complete REST API for projects/resources
- **Authentication**: Token-based for write operations

### IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

#### Ready for PLAN Mode Transition

The VAN analysis is complete. All requirements for **Level 3 complexity** confirmed:

- ✅ Architectural planning required (MCP server design)
- ✅ Data layer refactoring needed (hardcoded → API)
- ✅ External protocol integration (MCP)
- ✅ Multiple interconnected components

**STATUS**: VAN mode complete, ready for PLAN mode

#### Mode Transition Requirements

1. **User Action Required**: Type `PLAN` to begin planning phase
2. **Planning Focus**:
   - Data schema design and migration strategy
   - API architecture and endpoint design
   - MCP server architecture and protocol handling
   - Implementation roadmap and phase planning

### RISK MITIGATION NOTES

- **Data Migration Risk**: Extract data carefully to preserve all fields
- **Type Safety Risk**: Maintain TypeScript interfaces during refactoring
- **Performance Risk**: Plan caching strategy for API calls
- **UX Risk**: Ensure zero disruption to current user experience

## PROJECT OVERVIEW (Reference)

### Target Features

1. **MCP Integration**: Enable remote access to projects/resources via MCP clients
2. **API Refactoring**: Move from hardcoded data to JSON files + API endpoints
3. **Showcase Features**:
   - Remote data retrieval through MCP clients
   - Remote data updates demonstrating "automation magic"

### Success Criteria

- MCP integration working with Claude and other clients
- API endpoints for full CRUD operations
- Zero disruption to current user experience
- Compelling demonstration of remote automation capabilities

**NEXT ACTION**: User should type `PLAN` to begin detailed planning phase
